# Lyrix
A multi-syllable rhyme generator to assist in writing poetry or song lyrics. Build in Python on the Flask web framework, using the pronouncing dictionary from NLTK, and includes total user account functionality. Lyrix adds all user input into a sql database, where information including end-pronounciation is stored. Then, when a word or phrase is queried, the database is queried with possible matching end-pronouncations. Phonemes are acquired from the cmudict from NLTK.
